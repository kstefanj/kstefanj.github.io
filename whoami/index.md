My name is Stefan Johansson. I work in the HotSpot GC team at Oracle and Iâ€™ve been contributing to OpenJDK for the past 7 years. Before working directly in the JVM I spent another 7 years working closely with JVM technology in a couple of other projects (anyone remember JRockit Virtual Edition).

My main focus the last couple of years has been G1, but I also work very closely with the team building ZGC. I plan to use this blog as a channel to share thoughts, ideas and other things around garbage collection in OpenJDK. The views in the blog are personal and might not be shared by my employer.
